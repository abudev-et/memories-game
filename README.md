# Memories 2D Game 🎮

This project has been a great learning experience for me in JavaScript, especially in working with class-based components and 2D game development. Through this game, I have gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript concepts such as:

- ⚡ Object-oriented programming (OOP) with JavaScript classes
- 🎬 Handling game loops and animations
- 🕹️ Managing player interactions and game logic
- 🖱️ Implementing event listeners for user inputs

I did not focus much on CSS in this project, as my main goal was to strengthen my JavaScript skills. This project has helped me a lot in improving my understanding of JavaScript and game development fundamentals.

## 🎯 Game Concept
The objective of the game is to test and enhance the player's memory skills. Players are briefly shown an image and must recall and match the same image from a set of options. This challenges their short-term memory and pattern recognition abilities, making it both an engaging and educational experience.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- 🖥️ JavaScript (ES6+)
- 🎨 HTML5 Canvas

1. Clone the repository:
