# Memories 2D Game 🎮

This project has been a great learning experience for me in JavaScript, especially in working with class-based components and 2D game development. Through this game, I have gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript concepts such as:

- ⚡ Object-oriented programming (OOP) with JavaScript classes
- 🎬 Handling game loops and animations
- 🕹️ Managing player interactions and game logic
- 🖱️ Implementing event listeners for user inputs

I did not focus much on CSS in this project, as my main goal was to strengthen my JavaScript skills. This project has helped me a lot in improving my understanding of JavaScript and game development fundamentals.
